  <em>superuser and his toolbox<em>

# CyS3c t00lb0x
> CySec Toolbox is a collection of scripts I made


**genbin**: you will just need to give him some assembly instructions and he will generate you an optimized version of machine code!

**genscript**: this is a friend that just spawns a script template for binary ctfs

**fuckmyhex**: a cool guy. You don't wanna mess with him cause he speak 2 languages: binary and hex! And can do some very interesting manipulations with them...

**illtrace**: You can't escape. It will find your ptrace and NOP it. It's the big brother and he's watching you.

**gadget_finder**: automation tool to filter all the cool gadgets. It uses ROPgadget tool

**LOTTA1GADGETS**: automation tool that uses the one\_gadget tool and runs a script providing each one\_gadget found in input

**libc_analyzer**: dynamic analysis tool for extracting informations out of a libc shared object file and prints related informaitons.

**shellcodes**: the sweet honey. They always here when you need one (and they come in different flavors too).

**configurations**: Here I share all my config files. More efficiency, across multiple machines.
